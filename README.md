## Description
This repository contains my solution for **Week Two Assignment** from the Power Learn Project (PLP) Academy.  
The assignment demonstrates how to work with Python **built-in list methods** by performing various operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of elements.  

I am currently a **Software Development student at PLP Academy** and an aspiring **Full-Stack Developer and Digital Forensic Scientist**.  

## Assignment Instructions
The tasks implemented include:
1. Create an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Append elements `10, 20, 30, 40`.
3. Insert the value `15` at the second position.
4. Extend the list with `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Remove the last element.
6. Sort the list in ascending order.
7. Find and print the index of the value `30`.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
